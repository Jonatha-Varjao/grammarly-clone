## Post-v1.0 Ideas

These are not in scope for v1.0 but planned for future versions:

- [ ] Grammar-only analysis (without tone transformation)
- [ ] Multiple LLM provider support (Anthropic, Google AI)
- [ ] Language detection and translation
- [ ] Custom prompt templates
- [ ] Team/enterprise features
- [ ] Browser sync for settings
- [ ] Mobile companion app

## Success Criteria

v1.0 will be considered successful when:

1. ✅ Extension installs and loads without errors
2. ✅ User can select text and trigger analysis
3. ✅ Ollama connection works (or fallback to API)
4. ✅ At least 4 emotion transformations work correctly
5. ✅ User can copy or replace transformed text
6. ✅ Settings persist across browser sessions
7. ✅ No critical errors in console during normal use
